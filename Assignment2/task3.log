Checking the movies.csv file

Then, I got the first 200 rows from the movies.csv to a new file and I called it Laila.csv
I used the following command line:
$ head -n 200 movies.csv > Laila.csv

Then, I used the Sort command to sort the information by year in Laila.csv and I saved it in LailaSorted.csv
I used the following command line:
$ sort -t"(" -k2 Laila.csv > LailaSorted.csv
